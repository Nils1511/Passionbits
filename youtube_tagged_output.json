The iconic pony logo is recognized across the globe as a symbol of luxury and it’s usually the first thing many people think of when they imagine a polo shirt.\n\n00:45 The History of Ralph Lauren\n\nRalph Lauren was founded by Ralph Lifshitz in 1967. He named the company “Ralph Lauren” because he thought it’d be more marketable than with his true last name. \n\nThe Polo brand only grew in prestige after being featured prominently in 1974’s The Great Gatsby and later Annie Hall. The brand then gained global recognition as they expanded outside of the US starting in the 80s. The added global attention brought them in direct competition with LaCoste, who was the one who arguably first invented the original shirt style and Sunspel, who helped to popularize the pique cotton that polo shirts were made of.\n\n03:25 Ralph Lauren Polos in Contemporary Menswear\n\nThe popularity of Ralph Lauren Polos has remained a consistent mainstay in mainstream fashion, though they have ebbed and flowed throughout pop culture. The “pony” so prominently featured in Polo’s clothing got its initial appeal as a status symbol and remains a cornerstone of the brand to this day.\n\n04:53 Ralph Lauren Polo Product Range\n\nOne of Ralph Lauren’s most defining decisions was to break the brand down into several different lines. The actual Polo line has a large variety of offerings outside of their classic short sleeve mesh polo at $110 retail. This includes long-sleeved polos, polos with pockets and some interesting fabrics like Terry Cloth.\n\n08:30 Ralph Lauren Polo Construction\n\nOn the Ralph Lauren site, the iconic mesh shirt is simply listed as being made of “cotton”. Sure, there’s cotton in there, but without a listed amount it’s impossible to be certain it’s 100% cotton. It also has a ribbed collar, two-button placket, and ribbed armbands which are classic design features. We also don’t get any information on if the buttons are plastic, shell, or MOP. When you look at the stitching around the buttonholes, you can see that they’re stitched and then cut.\n\nWith all of these construction methods in mind, it looks like the classic polo shirt is definitely a mass-manufactured item.\n\n09:47 Assessing Ralph Lauren Polo Shirts\n\n13:09 Is It Worth It?\n\nIf you’re a fan of the Ralph Lauren brand, and like the history and prestige behind it, the Polo line Polo shirts are perhaps one of the most iconic garments they make. The Polo Line shirt certainly can be a dependable, good-looking product that is a perfectly valid option as an addition to your wardrobe. Ultimately making the Ralph Lauren Polo line Polo shirts worth it, on average.\n\n14:18 Outfit Rundown",

I got so many compliments from men and women at the party for wearing a simple pair of black loafers, tailored black dress pants, and a black polo from Collars & Co. I heard about the company from Shark Tank, where Mark Ruben invested a million dollars. Collars & Co. solved the problem of floppy polo collars with different options ranging from standard to button-down to dress-shirt. Other features are buttery soft-and-smooth fabric and sleeves that don't have that annoying band around them.\nAs you know, not all polo shirts are created equal. Some are stylish and sexy, whereas others make you look like a little boy or a boring and basic dad. You can elevate the aesthetic if you rock a polo properly. I will review some of the most significant polo-wearing mistakes most men make.\n\nDisheveled and sloppy collars. Most polos have wacky and crazy collars that don't look crisp and clean. They make men look like little boys rather than polished men. Elevate your polo style with a not-too-big or floppy collar. You can either iron it or upgrade the quality of your polo.\n\nClashing aesthetic. The look is mismatched if you wear a casual polo under a suit, especially if your collar is bad and basic. Make sure the polo underneath matches aesthetically.\n\nStriped and bright fabric. No man looks good in a striped polo shirt. I'm not saying all patterns are bad, as a smaller tight pattern is incredible. But stripes make men appear shorter, wider, and like little boys. Also, bright colors are not sexy. They are loud and make men look like they're wearing circus tents. Go with more subdued and muted colors.\n\nVisible undershirt. Being able to see an undershirt makes men look sloppy. With the placket open, the polo can make men's faces look chiseled and refined without the undershirt. If you're going to wear an undershirt, make sure it's a deep v.\n\nSkin tight. Cotton polos that have been thrown in the dryer shrink. You can see dudes rocking cropped polos all the time. Make sure your polo is not cropped or too tight. Look for it to hit the mid-crotch area. If you lift your arms up and your happy trail is visible, it's too short. Also, ensure it's not covering your crotch, or your body proportions will appear messed up and sloppy.\n\nDo you button your polo all the way? This look may be trendy, but having the placket open draws the eye down, making a man's face look more angular and chiseled.\n\nIs your polo collar wacky and balcony? This is a mistake.\n\nAre your polo sleeves short? A band on the sleeve will cinch the arm and make the sleeve look too high -- a douchey look.\n\nCan you see your mid-drift if you raise your arms while wearing a polo? You don't want to look like Britney Spears. You will get zero sex.\n\nIs your polo striped? This is not a good look.",

Chances are, you already own an array of these shirts, and every Classic wardrobe will benefit from the presence of at least one polo to serve as a casual sport shirt that is especially well-suited for warmer weather. \n\n01:04 History Of The Polo Shirt\n\nAs the name implies, the history of the polo shirt is closely linked to the history of the game of polo, although the modern polo shirt as we recognize it today looks very different from its ancient antecedent. \n\n03:10 The Polo Shirt Today\n\nFrom their origins on the polo fields, polo shirts have come to dominate menswear. Few other garments are seen on middle managers and suburban dads as often as they are glimpsed on celebrities and music stars. \n\n03:57 Polo Shirt Hallmarks: Materials\n04:38 Knits\n05:10 Sleeves & Cuffs\n06:12 Collars & Plackets\n07:39 Buttons & Buttonholes\n08:14 Other Details\n\nWhen selecting a polo shirt, take advantage of the following list of quality hallmarks to make a selection that falls within your desired price point while also leveraging the full potential of this versatile and functional garment.\n\n08:46 How to Style a Polo Shirt\n\nNow that you know how to find the best polo shirt, we will share with you tips and tricks to achieve the best possible look in your polo.\n\n11:42 How to Buy a Polo Shirt\n\nWhen it comes to a summer wardrobe, it’s not a bad idea to have a selection of polo shirts. I usually recommend at least having a navy and a white polo shirt but it’s wise to include other colors as well. Follow these guides to get tips for finding and buying the perfect polo shirt.\n\n12:08 Outfit Rundown\n\nKyle is wearing a tan polo shirt from Ralph Lauren, a famous purveyor of polo shirts. He has opted to wear it untucked, and selected a shirt with an appropriately short hem. To emphasize this more casual styling, Kyle's trousers are dark-washed jeans, which harmonize well with his dark brown, pebbled oxfords. The entire look is given a subtle pop of color thanks to his midnight blue and burgundy Fort Belvedere socks.",

    "text": "Polo shirts are an essential part of most men's wardrobe. They're a little more dressed up than t-shirts, but they're not nearly as formal actual dress shirts or even casual button up shirts.\n\nMy polo - https://shrsl.com/2631z \n\nPolos are extremely versatile. You can wear them with shorts, jeans, chinos or even wool trousers. In fact, you can even tuck them in and wear them under a blazer or sport coat.\n\nThe problem is, many men don't understand how polo shirts should fit, and they end up wearing ill-fitting polos that make them look shorter and fatter than they really are.\n\nThis is especially true for short men because it's hard to find a polo shirt that flatters men 5'8\" and under (at least from major brands, without any alterations).\n\nWhen it comes to how polo shirts should fit, there are three things to pay attention to:\n\n#1: Overall length\n#2: Body width (tight vs. baggy)\n#3: Sleeve length and width\n\nRemember: a polo shirt that fits is very flattering and versatile. But when your polo doesn't fit well, it's not a good look, especially if you're a man of modest height.\n\nQuestions? Ask me in the comments below!\n\n🧍🏻 My Sizes\n\nI'm 5'6\" with shoes on and about 123 lbs after dinner. I have a 34\" chest; I usually wear XS tops and 28x28 pants (sometimes hemmed to 27\").\n\n📸 My Gear\n\nCamera - http://geni.us/J626i\nLens - https://geni.us/5Ditjv\nShotgun Mic - http://geni.us/maFN\nDesk Mic - https://geni.us/uCBKS\nMic Arm - https://geni.us/iPSr\nLaptop - https://geni.us/zZlxFFb\nKeyboard - https://geni.us/wDXb (Amazon)\n\n🛠️ Resources\n\nIncome Reports - https://fulltimeblog.com/\nHow to Start a Fashion Blog - https://mdst.mn/safb\nBlogging Tools - http://bit.ly/2ymUxO7\nYouTube Music - http://share.epidemicsound.com/modest\n\n👕 Style Guides\n\nFree eBooks - http://mdst.mn/guide-pack\nPremium Guide - http://mdst.mn/tmmsg\n\n👉 Find Me On\n\nBlog - https://www.themodestman.com\nPodcast - http://fave.co/2vej94M\nInstagram -   / brockmcgoff  \nTwitter -   / mcgoff  \nFacebook -   / modestmanblog  \nFB Group -   / modestmen  \n\n———\nContains affiliate links // Stay stylish!",

But in today’s ever casual world, it can be a genuine challenge to find an alternative to a dress shirt that is of equal quality and standing for a lover of classic style. So it’s with this in mind that we look towards Sunspel, a brand offering a clean, cool take on how traditional casualwear can be relevant for the 21st Century.\n\n01:00 History of Sunspel\n\nThomas Hill founded Sunspel in 1860 when he opened a hosiery and underwear factory. Instead of manufacturing man-tights for local vigilantes, Hill’s aim was to create beautiful, everyday clothing from the world’s finest fabrics. Ten years later, in 1900, the company starts importing the world’s rarest and finest cotton, Sea Island cotton from the Caribbean. \n\nContinuing to innovate, the year 1914 saw the introduction of Cellular cotton.  Sunspel factory also relocates to the nearby town of Long Eaton. The year 2005 marks the sale of the company from then 81-year-old Peter Hill to Nicholas Brooke and Dominic Hazlehurst.\n\nAs the company changed and grew into the 21st century, costume designer, Lindy Hemming, saw a unique opportunity to utilize the brand’s rich British history to outfit James Bond in 2006’s Casino Royale.\n\n04:23 Sunspel Today\n\n05:36 T-Shirt or Undershirt?\n\nThat being said, there is a difference between a T-Shirt and an undershirt which is important because Sunspel offers both. So although they might look similar at first glance, there are a few characteristics of both varieties that set them apart.\n\n07:10 T-Shirts\n\n Sunspel does offer a few different varieties of T-Shirt models often being made in a different fabric or featuring different details such as a long sleeve or a V neck but the style we’re looking at today is their iconic, classic T-shirt.\n\n09:40 Polo Shirts\n\nBy far the most popular style of polo shirt in the range is the Riviera model, which is crafted from Sunspel’s unique Q75 warp knit cotton, a two-button placket at the collar, a patch pocket on the left breast, and flat, stitched seams. Meanwhile, the Sea island cotton polo shirts feature a three-button placket at the collar, a flat front with no additional pocket, and ribbed seams. \n\nSunspel also offers a traditional pique cotton polo shirt, which is closer in style to the Sea Island cotton polos.\n\n12:45 Are Sunspel Shirts Worth It?\n\nIn our experience, Sunspel’s everyday, Classic cotton jersey T-shirts and Riviera polo shirts are of excellent quality, wash and wear well, and most importantly, fit into our classic wardrobes effortlessly.\n\n14:07 Outfit Rundown",

For this head to head, I've queued up six pique polos since I've selected this range by browsing blogs, reddit, youtube videos and fashion magazines to find the most popular ones. My ideal polo is one that nails 5 things: fit, fabric, collar, and overall construction. Let's find the best polo for men! \n\nFirst we have the Uniqlo Dry Pique Short Sleeve Polo Shirt. It came in right around $20 and I honestly don't have many complaints at this price point. I'm 5'10 and weigh in at 175 pounds so I went true to size with medium. It is the most relaxed of the bunch when it comes to fit.\nThe fabric on this polo is nothing special but gets the job done. The single layer collar on this shirt is flimsy. The placket is nice and deep and the plastic buttons are expected at this price point. I like the split hem and the ribbed cuffs. Overall, it's a great polo for $20 but might not look as tailored and polished as most guys would want a polo to look.\n\nNext we have Kent Wang's polo. I got my hands on this white one in a size medium that goes for $65. Kent Wang claims these to be very slim fit but they fit slightly slimmer than a normal custom fit. The fabric is structured and the weave isn't too tight or too loose. It's comparable to Polo Ralph Lauren. The highlight of this polo has to be the collar. I found this to be much stronger than the competition and it hasn't lost it's shape at all. The placket is a perfect depth.  Kent Wang seems like a no nonsense kind of brand. The inner branding seems prone to peeling At $65 this thing is good value for money. \n\nLet us move on to Lacoste. Lacoste is considered the OG of the men's polo world. They retail for $90 but certain colors can be found for around $50 on sale. Sizing is weird on this one so I would go try them on in store prior to purchasing. I got a classic fit small. The front and back are the same length making this harder to tuck in. I love the longer sleeves that still manage to hug the arms. The fabric on this polo was thin, lightweight and breathable with the pique being on the finer side. The combination makes it perfect for warmer days. The finer weave makes the polo look like it has less texture compared to the rest and it feels near identical to Loro Piana. The collar was disappointing on this Lacoste polo. The deep placket helped give the polo shirt a more upscale look in my opinion. If it wasn’t for the collars, I could see myself having multiples of these in my wardrobe.\n\nNext up we have Polo Ralph Lauren. I’ve worn a custom fit medium for years now. The polo hugs the arms and chest and tapers towards the waist. The length is an inch or two short for my preference but it’s worth the tradeoff since everything else fits well. The fabric is okay and average. The collar was disappointing and flimsy. The placket is short so you can wear it unbuttoned without looking arrogant. In terms of quality and price, there are definitely better options out there. They retail for $95 but it’s fairly easy to find them much cheaper at department stores.\n\nThe Sunspel Riviera polo was made for James Bond (Daniel Craig) Casino Royale. I ordered mine in a size medium in the Forest color way. The polo is trim but not overly slim. The sleeves hit right at your mid-bicep and did not restrict my movement. The fabric is exceptional and the collar is very strong. The buttons were cheap looking and the pocket was something I personally did not like but that is subjective. There’s just something about wearing James Bonds polo that give you a little extra pep in your step.I bought mine for $135 but I’ve been seeing them one sale for $64 on Sunspel website frequently depending on color.\n\nFinally we have Loro Piana. I ended up going with the cotton one for a whopping $545 before taxes in a size medium in the optic white color. The build quality and fit and finish were exceptional but that’s to be expected on a $600 polo. The placket was the deepest and the pearl buttons were nice. Loro Piana's polo had a curved hem and a stiff collar. \n\nIf you read this far down, drop a 🍁 in the comments!\n\nCamera I use: https://amzn.to/2Ja6IEj\nWooden Hangers: https://amzn.to/3uYlPpH\nDisclaimer: Affiliate links",

Whereas the OCBD was once the shirt of the moment, being produced and replicated by seemingly every sartorial outlet, the long-sleeved polo is now seemingly everywhere.\n\n02:05 Not All Long-Sleeve Polos are the Same\n\nLong-sleeve polo shirts can be a little trickier to define than an OCBD! For example, it’s easy to confuse long-sleeve polos with rugby shirts. However, the Rugby shirt has a few more distinct characteristics. \n\nSome long-sleeved polo shirts are simply standard cotton polo shirts with longer arms. Some long-sleeve polos are made from wool and are closer to sweaters. Some long sleeve polo shirts lean heavier into the “shirt” element of the design.\n\n05:04 Shirt vs. Shirt: Similarities\n→ possess a long body that’s designed to be tucked in\n→ the long sleeves\n→ Barrel cuffs. Neither long sleeve polos nor OCBD shirts should be worn with double or “French” cuffs\n→ structured collars\n\n07:37 Shirt vs. Shirt: Differences\n→ OCBD shirts are famously made with Oxford cloth. Long-sleeve polo shirts are made from pique cotton\n→ OCBD shirts button fully in the front\n→ long-sleeve polo shirts are typically constructed in a pop-over style\n→ the collar buttons down to the shirt front with OCBD \n→ OCBD shirts have the ability to be worn with or without neckwear. Long-sleeve polo shirts are primarily designed to be worn without neckwear\n\n09:58 Are Long-Sleeved Polos the New OCBD?\n\nIn an increasingly casual world, any shirt with long sleeves and a structured collar can be seen as “formal”. On that merit alone, it’s easy to suggest you use whichever type of shirt you please, and you’ll be considered smartly attired in most situations.\n\nSpeaking as to strict formality, OCBDs are a touch more formal than the long-sleeve polo.\n\n11:45 Conclusion\n\nIt’s safe to say that there’s space on the throne for two elegant casual shirt styles as both long sleeve polos and OCBD shirts have a place in a classic clothing enthusiast’s wardrobe. Whichever you choose, we’d love to hear about your favorite brands & how you like to wear them in the comments!\n\n12:10 Outfit Rundown",

    "text": "A polo shirt is an absolute essential for spring and summer style. It's classic. It's simple. Every guy should have a few in his wardrobe. But how can you break out of the ubiquitous polo shirt and khakis mold? Well in this video, I'm showing you three mildly out of the box ways to style a polo shirt, including how to wear a polo shirt with a jacket, wearing a polo shirt with a suit, and one way to spice up the \"classic\" polo shirt styling.\n\nFEATURED POLO SHIRT\n▪ J.Crew Classic Polo → https://shopstyle.it/l/2ZHF\n\n1. POLO SHIRT WITH A BLAZER\n\nCan you wear a polo shirt with a jacket? Yes, you can. I like this styling for a variety of reasons. The unstructured nature of a polo shirt’s collar lends itself to a more easygoing look. Under a blazer, it has the effect of dressing it down, looking more casual and relaxed. Additionally, the polo shirt’s short sleeves feel a lot better under a blazer during the spring and summer than a long-sleeved button-up. \n\n▪ Suitsupply Blazer (similar) → https://shopstyle.it/l/2ZE4\n▪ Ring Jacket Chinos (similar) → https://shopstyle.it/l/2ZE7\n▪ Homero Ortega Panama Hat → http://bit.ly/2PM5T3t\n▪ IWC Ingenieur → https://shopstyle.it/l/2ZF1\n▪ Allen Edmonds Loafers (discontinued, similar) → http://bit.ly/2PQ9TQc\n\n2. POLO SHIRT WITH A SUIT\n\nGuess what? You can wear a polo shirt with a suit as well. Admittedly, a polo shirt is not the first shirt you're going to reach for to pair with a shirt, but if the goal is to make a formal garment more casual, then it's a good choice. Because the collar doesn't have much structure, you might consider wearing it outside the jacket over the lapel to give the appearance of a bit more structure. \n\n▪ Alton Lane Suit → http://bit.ly/2PPACg7\n▪ A. Lange & Söhne Datograph → https://shopstyle.it/l/2ZHQ\n▪ Belgian Shoes Loafers → http://bit.ly/2ER3L7V\n\n3. ELEVATED \"CLASSIC\" POLO SHIRT STYLING\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with the polo shirt and khakis look--you just see it a lot. Like, a lot. Elevate that American dude \"uniform\" by going deeper and thinking about the details. Swap the cotton trousers for linen. Get a pair made and go with side adjusters instead of belt loops. Throw on a Panama hat. And anchor the look with some luxe suede loafers rather than boat shoes.\n\n▪ Saks Linen Trousers (MTM, similar) → https://shopstyle.it/l/2ZGF\n▪ Homero Ortega Panama Hat → http://bit.ly/2PM5T3t\n▪ Patek Philippe 5711 → http://bit.ly/2D2t71B\n▪ Baudoin & Lange Loafers → https://shopstyle.it/l/2ZIk\n\nPOLO SHIRT HISTORY\n\nThe polo shirt is a piece of menswear you’d think would have a pretty straight-forward history and origin story. It’s in the name, right? A ‘polo’ shirt clearly was developed as a uniform for polo players! But that’s where you’d be wrong.\n\nAs a matter of fact, polo shirts were first used in the sport of tennis, making the common name a misnomer. Back in the day, the tennis uniform, or tennis ‘whites,’ consisted of a long sleeve, white dress shirt worn with the sleeves rolled up.\n\nThis was paired with dress trousers and usually a tie. The final result was not very comfortable or conducive to running and swinging a tennis racket. But in those days, fashion won over functionality and everyone called it a day. Except for tennis star Jean René Lacoste...\n\nKeep reading → http://hespokestyle.com/polo-shirt-hi...\n—\nJoin the community as an insider:\nhttps://hespokestyle.com/newsletter-s...\n\nShop essential menswear:\nhttps://hespokestyle.com/shop/\n\nBrowse the essential men’s style library:\nhttps://kit.co/hespokestyle/essential...\n\n---\n\nNEW VIEWER?

Even though they sell a bunch of different things, front and center is definitely their polo shirt.\n\nMost Lacoste polos are made from a piqué knit, but they also have jersey knits and a t-shirt style material. They’re almost made out of 100% cotton, and there are some blends. If you want to learn more about the best polo shirt materials, our guide has you covered.\n\nLacoste Polo Shirt Review\nWe look at seven different Lacoste polo shirts, and all of them were 100% cotton, which is fairly the standard for the brand, at least in the US. \n03:58 Material & Quality\n06:58 Colorfastness and Color Range\n07:20 Collars\n08:10 Buttons and Buttonholes\n09:35 Logo Detail\n10:24 Construction\n11:36 Shirt Pricing\n12:35 Different Models\n13:22 How do Lacoste Polos Fit?\n\nIn our experience, Lacoste's original polo, overall, quite small for American size. That being said, there are differences between the sizes. In terms of length, the classic is longer than the regular, which is longer than the slim.\n\nWhile the Paris polo comes in a classic fit and a regular fit. It’s different visually because it has a hidden front placket, so you don’t see the buttons, and the collar is definitely smaller. Also, the famous crocodile logo is tone-on-tone, so it’s a little more subdued. And, personally, I’d rather have no logos on my chest, so I’d rather wear the Paris polo than their original one.\n\n16:36 Other Styles Lacoste Offers\n18:43 Pros of a Lacoste Polo Shirt\n19:28 Cons of a Lacoste Polo Shirt\n\n20:35 Is the Lacoste Polo Shirt Worth It?\nFirst of all, figure out what you want out of your polo shirt. If you just want something to wear while doing your garden work or run around the house, maybe spending the extra money on the Lacoste branding is not justified. If you wear polo shirts regularly during the summer and enjoy wearing them, it can be a good contender.\n\nThe big questions, then, are: Does the polo fit you, or does it puddle weirdly? Or does it have weird wrinkles, and do you like the fit and the style, as well as the fabric they offer?\n\nDo you want a polo shirt in just the basic colors such as navy or, maybe, gray? Then, you can go with other brands. But, if you want those special, unusual colors, I think Lacoste is really good.\n\nWhen it comes to brands, here at Gentleman’s Gazette, we, generally, don’t put too much value or emphasis on that, and we rather look at the quality and the value, which is the quality to price ratio.\n\n24:34 Outfit Rundown",
